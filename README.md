The Scientific Stack

1. NumPy: NumPy provides a multidimensional array object to store homogeneous or heterogeneous data; it also provides optimized functions/methods to operate on this array object.

2. SciPy: SciPy is a collection of subpackages and functions implementing importand standard functionality often needed in science or finance; for example, one finds functions for cubic splines interpolation as well as for numerical integration.

3. matplotlib: This is the most popular plotting and visualization package for Python, providing both 2D and 3D visualization capabilities.

4. pandas: pandas builds on NumPy and provides richer classes for the management and analysis of time series and tabular data; it is tightly integrated with matplotlib for plotting and PyTables for data storage and retrieval.

5. scikit-learn: is a popular programming language that provides a unified API for many different ML algorithms, such as for estimation, classification, or clustering

6. PyTables: PyTables is a popular wrapper for the HDF5 data storage package; it is a package to implement optimized, disk-based I/O operations based on a hierarchical database/file format
