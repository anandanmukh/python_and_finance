Why Python?

1. Interpreted: The reference CPython implementation is an interpreter of the language that translates Python code at runtime to executable byte code.

2. Multiparadigm: Python supports different programming and implementation paradigms, such as object orientation and imperative, functional or procedural programming.

3. Multipurpose: Python can be used for rapid, interactive code development as well as for building large applications; it can be used for low-level systems operations as well as for high-level analytics tasks.

4. Cross-platfrom: Python is available for the most important operation systems sucha s Windows, Linux, macOS and even on small devices as the Rasberry Pi.

5. Dynamically Typed: Types in Python are in general inferred at runtime and not statically declared as in most compliled languages

6. Indentation aware: In contrast to the majority of other programming languages, Python uses indentation for marking code blocks instead of parenthesis, brackets or semicolons.

7. Garbage Collecting: Python has automated garbage collection, avoiding the need for the programmer to manage memory.


The Scientific Stack:

1. NumPy: NumPy provides a multidimensional array object to store homogeneous or heterogeneous data; it also provides optimized functions/methods to operate on this array object.

2. SciPy: SciPy is a collection of subpackages and functions implementing importand standard functionality often needed in science or finance; for example, one finds functions for cubic splines interpolation as well as for numerical integration.

3. matplotlib: This is the most popular plotting and visualization package for Python, providing both 2D and 3D visualization capabilities.

4. pandas: pandas builds on NumPy and provides richer classes for the management and analysis of time series and tabular data; it is tightly integrated with matplotlib for plotting and PyTables for data storage and retrieval.

5. scikit-learn: is a popular programming language that provides a unified API for many different ML algorithms, such as for estimation, classification, or clustering

6. PyTables: PyTables is a popular wrapper for the HDF5 data storage package; it is a package to implement optimized, disk-based I/O operations based on a hierarchical database/file format
